# Vision and Simulation Primer

This document explains how the robot simulates gamepieces and vision cameras, and how that simulated data feeds into the actual robot code. This architecture allows us to test autonomous routines and vision logic without a physical robot or real cameras.

## 1. The Architecture Overview

The simulation is designed to be **transparent** to the robot code. The `Vision` subsystem doesn't know if it's reading data from a real Raspberry Pi or from our physics engine.

**Data Flow:**
1. **Physics Engine (`physics.py`)**: The main loop that runs the simulation.
2. **Gamepiece Sim (`simulation/gamepiece_sim.py`)**: Tracks where gamepieces are on the field.
3. **Vision Sim (`simulation/vision_sim.py`)**: Calculates what the cameras "see" based on the robot's position.
4. **NetworkTables**: The communication bridge. The Sim *publishes* data here, just like a real camera would.
5. **Vision Subsystem (`subsystems/vision.py`)**: *Subscribes* to NetworkTables to read the data.

## 2. The Gamepiece Simulator

Located in `simulation/gamepiece_sim.py`.

### Responsibilities
- **Spawning**: Creates a list of gamepieces (Coral/Algae) at specific field coordinates defined in `__init__`.
- **Consumption**: In every simulation step, it checks the distance between the robot and every active gamepiece.
  - If the robot drives over a gamepiece (distance < threshold), it is marked as "consumed" (inactive) and disappears.
- **Reset**: If all gamepieces are consumed, they automatically reset to their starting positions.
- **Visualization**: Updates a `FieldObject` named "Gamepieces" on the dashboard's Field2d widget so you can see them.

## 3. The Vision Simulator

Located in `simulation/vision_sim.py`. This is the "Virtual Coprocessor".

### How it works
It takes the **Robot's Truth Pose** (from the physics engine) and the list of **Active Gamepieces**.

For each camera defined in `constants.CameraConstants.k_cameras`:
1. **Geometry Check**: It calculates the vector from the robot to every gamepiece.
2. **Filtering**:
   - **Distance**: Is the gamepiece closer than `k_cam_distance_limit`?
   - **Field of View (FOV)**: Is the angle to the gamepiece within the camera's view cone? (Taking into account the camera's mounting rotation on the robot).
3. **Selection**: It picks the *closest* valid gamepiece.
4. **Publishing**: It writes the target details to NetworkTables topics (e.g., `/Cameras/LogitechReef/hsv/distance`).
   - **Note**: It calculates "Strafe" (lateral offset) and "Rotation" relative to the camera, mimicking real vision processing.

### Visualization
If `k_draw_camera_fovs` is True, it draws triangles on the Field2d widget representing the view cone of each camera.
- **Triangle**: The camera sees targets inside this area.
- **Empty**: If the triangle disappears (and `k_do_blink_test` is on), the camera connection is being simulated as "lost".

## 4. The Vision Subsystem

Located in `subsystems/vision.py`.

This is the code that runs on the real robot. It does **not** do any simulation math. It simply trusts NetworkTables.

### Key Methods
- `target_available(camera_key)`: Checks if the camera sees a target AND if the data timestamp is fresh.
- `get_distance(...)`, `get_strafe(...)`: Returns the raw numbers from NetworkTables.
- `nearest_to_cam(...)`: Converts the camera-relative data (Distance/Rotation) back into a **Field-Relative Pose** or **Robot-Relative Pose** so the robot knows where to drive.

> **Crucial Concept**: The subsystem uses the `CameraConstants.k_cameras` dictionary in `constants.py` to know which NetworkTables topics to listen to. This configuration is the "Source of Truth" for both the Sim and the Real Robot.

## 5. Simulation Features & Flags

You can control the simulation behavior in `constants.py` under `SimConstants`.

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `k_disable_vision` | **True**: Stops the Vision Sim entirely. Use this when you have a real camera connected to the simulator (Hardware-in-the-Loop). |
| `k_draw_camera_fovs` | **True**: Draws the blue FOV triangles on the field. Useful for debugging blind spots. |
| `k_do_blink_test` | **True**: Randomly turns cameras on and off to test if your robot code handles connection failures gracefully. |

## 6. How to Use It

1. **Run the Simulator**:
   ```bash
   python robot.py sim
   ```
2. **Open the Dashboard (Glass)**:
   - Add the **Field** widget.
   - You will see:
     - **Robot**: The main robot icon.
     - **Gamepieces**: Small icons (usually boxes) at specific locations.
     - **FOV Cones**: Triangles projecting from the robot.
     - **Ghost Robot**: A translucent robot showing the autonomous target pose (if Auto is running).

3. **Drive**:
   - Use the joysticks to drive the robot.
   - Drive into a gamepiece -> It disappears (Consumed).
   - Point a camera at a gamepiece -> The dashboard LEDs for that camera should light up (Target Found).
